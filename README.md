## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCss
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learn to how flex works in Tailwindcss. I can now apply my gained knowledge in making my own custom website with good looking UI.


### Continued development

I am not fully comfortable in applying the concept of tailwindcss to my pages which i am hoping to learn along the way as i complete more challenges in Frontend mentor.

### Useful resources

- [TailWindCss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to learn and apply tailwindcss. I really liked this approach to style html elements..
